FILE: Positions.py
PURPOSE: Class that puts together options (groups of instances of Option class) to create more complex positions for analysis. Position is created,
legs are added (if not provided in constructor), then Position is initialized. After initialization, stats are available. If you add legs to the
position after initializing, just re-initialize: but the initial value will change.

Constructor:

__init__(name = ""):
	- name is optional, some combinations of options have names, ex: "Bull Put Spread" or "Iron Condor" 

Methods:

add_leg(option):
	- add Call or Put of class Option to the position

initialize():
	- generates stats object for position info (max loss/gain, breakevens, etc)
	- calculates initial value based on all legs in position
	- assigns current ticker for whole position to first option in list legs (positions only span one ticker)

refresh_value():
	- updates value of position based on positions of all individual option legs. Does NOT update each leg: they need to be updated on their own
