PURPOSE: This class creates option objects for individual options, to be used as positions or as legs in more complex positions.

Constructor:

__init__(ticker, strike, expir_date, type, initial_premium = None, create_date = None):
	- ticker is string, ex "AAPL"
	- strike is number (int or float)
	- type is string "LONG" or "SHORT"
	- expir_date can be a datetime object or a string formatted "MM/DD/YY", it can accept both. Across the project datetime objects are always preferred and there is an attempt to 
	  keep it a standard to always use datetime objects, then translate into the format needed last second
	- initial_premium is optional to enter a premium other than the one created in the moment, in case for example the option was opened a while ago
	- create_date is same format as expir_date, optional

Methods:
